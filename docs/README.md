# About ClockWorksProduction

ClockWorksProduction is a creative collective and production house with a passion for bringing imaginative projects to life. We are involved in various creative endeavors, including game development, animation, and virtual entertainment.

We operate through three distinct branches:

- **CWP Studio** – Our game development arm dedicated to creating enjoyable and interactive learning experiences through games. We aim to explore new ways of learning that are both educational and fun.
- **FrameForge** – Our animation studio that specializes in producing stylized visuals and creative short films. Our process is fueled by "Coffee + Synifig + Passion." You can see examples of our work like "MLBT."
- **PixelPulse** – CWP's in-house VTuber group, a collective of virtual talents focusing on enjoyable learning and fun through streams and videos. AgentBlackTigerStreams is an example of a VTuber within PixelPulse.

Through these branches, ClockWorksProduction strives to push creative boundaries and deliver unique and engaging content.
