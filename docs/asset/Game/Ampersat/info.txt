Description:
A shooty, slashy, RPG-y game mixing retro and modern sensibilities. A blend of influences from Gauntlet & Smash TV to Zelda & Angband, Ampersat is a handcrafted adventure but with appeal to Roguelite fans. Battle ASCII creatures in colorful areas & free letters to return language to the village!
