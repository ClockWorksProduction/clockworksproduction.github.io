# Welcome to the CWP Open Terminal Emulator

A modular, BASH-style terminal emulator library for the web. CWP Open Terminal Emulator is a lightweight, extensible, and easy-to-integrate solution for adding a terminal interface to your web applications.

This documentation will guide you through the installation, configuration, and use of the library, as well as provide a detailed reference for the API and other features.

## Key Features

*   **Virtual File System:** An in-memory file system to simulate file and directory operations.
*   **Extensible Addon System:** Create your own commands and applications that run inside the terminal.
